    A fish is an aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animal that lacks limbs with digits. Included in this definition 
    are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Approximately 95% of living
    fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging to the class Actinopterygii, with around 99% of those being teleosts.
    <BR>
    The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during the Cambrian period. 
    Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their invertebrate counterparts.
    Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms. Many fish of the Paleozoic developed 
    external armor that protected them from predators. The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks)
    became formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.
